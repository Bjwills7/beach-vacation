# beach-vacation
This is one my flexbox projects for The Odin Project. It's a made up guide to planning a gulf coast vacation.
It is not optimized for mobile yet.

This version is not the official one I will be using for The Odin Project going forward. It's purpose was to test out a bunch of different tools in css for practice.
